<img width= "75%"length="40%" src="https://thumbs.dreamstime.com/z/honey-badger-5222102.jpg"/>







<p>When startled they rush at their assailants, releasing a potent scent from their anal glands, rattling and standing tall with their hackles raised. This usually scares the predator away. Even if a badger is caught, its loose skin enables it to twist round and bite its attacker. Despite their small size, the honey badger is prehaps one of the most determined mammal in the world.</p>






<br/><strong> The Tardigrade</strong>
<p></p>

<p>Tardigrades are known as water bears or even space bears. It is rare to find ones greater than 1.5 millimeters in size,but there have been some cases. Do not let there extreme small size fool you, as they are an incredibally tough species. Water Bears are able to survive at extremely hot temperatures  and brain freezing temperatures where a human would die in seconds.</p>

<p></p>








<img width="75%"length="40%"src="https://thumbs.dreamstime.com/z/emperor-penguin-16892256.jpg"/>





<p>Flightless and clumsy on land, but swift and elusive underwater these remarkable birds have earned themselves spot on thetoughest animals list.But weighing 80 pounds and swimming like a torpedo is hardly enough to offset awkward waddling and a lack of teeth or claws, so why is the emperor penguin so high on this list? Because emperor penguins live in Antarctica, the world's harshest and most unforgiving environment..</p>

<p></p>





<img width="75%"length="40%"src="https://thumbs.dreamstime.com/z/polar-bear-29512191.jpg"/>





<p>Polar bears are the largest bears in the world, in fact the are the largestland carnivore in the world. Many people imagine a polar bear as a cute cuddly animal, but they couldn't be more wrong. Polar bears are extremely dangerous weighing up to 1200lbs and can be up to 10ft tall! Like all bears, polar bears are always on the hunt for food but they are the only carnivorous bear. They rely soley on meat, their favorite prey are seals, but they have been known to eat walruses, fish, birds and even eggs! To live in an enviroment as harsh as this, you mot only need to be tough. You have to be born tough and the polar has proved its worth. </p>

<P>The Orlov Trotter is Russia’s most famous breed of horse. At one time the fastest harness horse on the European continent, the Orlov’s massive beauty, weight-bearing strength and long-distance stamina have also contributed to its pride of place in the history of Russian horse breeding. The story of the Orlov Trotter is the stuff of legend, embellished by the romance of the Russian troika and ennobled by its representation in Russian literature. The Orlov trotter was bred by Count Orlov, who desired to create a horse that could tolerate russia. A horse that could bear the long freezing temperatures,the terrible russian roads and go without food for long distances. In otherwords, be the ultimate horse good for the people and the military. The count was extremely wealthy and while everyone else was seeking to find this horse he set out to build one. He aqquired horses from allover Europe and the Middle East until he had finally found his magic horse.
